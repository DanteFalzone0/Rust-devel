# Rust-devel
Dante's first forays into the Rust programming language.

I much prefer the SDL2 bindings to ggez because I haven't been able to
get ggez to reliably work. Additionally, I've already become familiar
with some of the SDL2 API in C and C++, so I already have a sense of how
SDL2 is generally used.

At some point I ought to write up a tutorial for using SDL2 in Rust...
