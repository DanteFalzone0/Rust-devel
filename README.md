I am archiving much of my old code from when I was first learning to program. The code in this repository is embarassingly bad, and it's not how I would write code to do something similar today. Please don't take this repository as an example of my programming habits and knowledge; look at my more recent repositories instead. */


# Rust-devel
Dante's first forays into the Rust programming language.

I much prefer the SDL2 bindings over ggez because I haven't been able to
get ggez to reliably work. Additionally, I've already become familiar
with some of the SDL2 API in C and C++, so I already have a sense of how
SDL2 is generally used.

At some point I ought to write up a tutorial for using SDL2 in Rust...


Edit 13/9/2019: I'm considering moving threedox into its own repository.
